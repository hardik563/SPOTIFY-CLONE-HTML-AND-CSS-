I have developed a Spotify clone using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
While it is a foundational project, it has been an invaluable
learning experience, allowing me to apply core web development
principles in a practical setting. This project represents my current 
learning stage and showcases my strong desire to continuously grow and 
improve. My ambition is to evolve into a full-stack developer, 
and as I advance, I am committed to building more complex and
sophisticated applications by constantly learning new technologies. 
I am deeply grateful to Shraddha ma'am, whose excellent teaching
and guidance provided me with the fundamental concepts to bring
this project to life.
